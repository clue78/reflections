What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository a hidden directory is created, in which git saves the data for the tracking of the commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	In the repository git keeps track of the changes, that are made. In the working directory there are the files, that are not necessarily tracked. The value of the staging area is that of a try and error space.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Before commiting a change check the diff between the working area and the staging area. Make sure, only the changes, you want to commit are in the staging area and then commit the change.
