When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on a project together it's great to have the repository online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  The remote repository can be changed, when it is public. As I don't want the files on my copmuter to be changed without knowing, I prefer to pull changes and not have them changed automatically.
